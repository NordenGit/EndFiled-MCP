# Changelog

All notable changes to Endfield-MCP (TypeScript implementation) are recorded
here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **stdio clients now share one loaded dataset.** stdio spawns one server
  per client, so every Claude Desktop window and Claude Code session used to
  parse its own copy of the same tables — three clients meant three full
  datasets in memory. The first process to start now becomes the host: it
  loads the data and additionally listens on a loopback port, and later
  processes bridge their stdin/stdout to it without loading anything. The
  election is the port bind itself, so there is no lockfile, no daemon and
  no orphan; a client that loses the race re-probes and bridges instead.
  The port is derived from a fingerprint of version + data paths + user, so
  separate checkouts, versions and users never share a process, and the host
  binds `127.0.0.1` only. Set `EF_SHARE=0` for the previous behaviour.
- **`parseInt64Safe` no longer copies the document it scans.** It appended
  one character at a time, so a 10 MB table cost ~10M string concatenations
  and the intermediate ropes dwarfed the parsed result. It now scans without
  copying and splices only around the integers it actually rewrites,
  returning the original string untouched when nothing needs rewriting.
  Measured on a single `ef_list_characters` call: 851 MB → 335 MB resident.
  Behaviour is unchanged — `tests/storesInt64Equivalence.test.ts` checks the
  new scanner against the original implementation on randomized documents.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-29 — Worldbuilding (PRTS archive & in-game wiki)

### Added

- **Worldbuilding domain — the in-game lore system.** Exposes the PRTS
  archive (documents/records/multimedia/investigations) and the in-game
  encyclopedia (wiki entries cross-linked to lore documents), previously
  completely inaccessible to creators. Four new `ef_*` tools (count 15 → 19):
  - `ef_list_lore_categories` — browse the PRTS archive + wiki category trees
  - `ef_search_lore` — regex search across all PRTS document bodies
  - `ef_read_lore_document` — read one document's full resolved body
  - `ef_get_wiki_entry` — read a wiki entry + follow its `prtsId` cross-link
- **New data layer** mirroring the story domain's barrel split
  (`worldviewCore`/`Categories`/`Documents`/`Search` + barrel facade). A
  **RichContent bridge** (local to `worldviewCore.ts`) resolves PRTS document
  bodies: `contentId` → `RichContentTable[contentId].contentList[]` → i18n.
  Kept local so `texts.ts` stays hash-only by design.
- **Wiki ↔ Prts cross-link navigation.** `WikiEntryData.prtsId` points into a
  `PrtsDocument`; `ef_get_wiki_entry` surfaces the associated lore document,
  and `ef_read_lore_document` reverse-lists wiki entries referencing it.
- **New mirror Release** `endfield-worldview.zip` (v0.4.0,
  `3aKHP/EndFieldGameData`) — 11 PRTS + 4 Wiki tables +
  `RichContentTable.json` (~126KB). i18n body text reuses the v0.2.0 tables
  bundle's `i18n/CN.json` (not re-bundled).

### Fixed

- **Bundled fallback now includes the worldview dataset.** `fetch-bundled-data.ts`
  previously pulled only tables + story; the worldview bundle was missing, so
  the npm package's offline fallback layer would have shipped without worldview
  data (every offline install would see worldview tools report "unavailable").
- **Wiki-entry cache invalidation.** `_wikiEntryData` (in `worldviewDocuments.ts`)
  was not cleared by `clearDocumentCaches()` — stale wiki entry data would
  persist after a sync refresh. Now reset alongside `_firstLvCategory`. (Found
  by khpilot bot + subagent CR, PR #19.)
- **`isEmptyLoc` numeric-id coercion.** The upstream "absent" marker
  `{id:0, text:""}` arrives with `id` as a number (≤2^53 ids aren't quoted by
  the int64-safe parser); a strict `=== "0"` comparison missed it, leaking the
  literal "0" as a wiki description. Now coerces via `String()`. (Found by
  subagent CR, PR #19.)

### Decisions

- **`listWikiGroups` casing** normalized to always return the canonical map
  key (case-insensitive scan), fixing inconsistent casing between branches.
- **Smoke test deferred** in the CD pipeline — the tool set is still shifting
  pre-1.0; revisit once stabilized.

## [0.3.4] — 2026-06-29 — Sync multi-asset fix

### Fixed

- **Release sync no longer assumes `/releases/latest` carries every asset.**
  `sync.ts:checkLatestRelease` used GitHub's `/releases/latest` endpoint,
  which returns the single newest Release for the whole repo and assumes it
  contains every asset. That assumption held while the mirror shipped one
  asset type per Release, but broke the moment `endfield-worldview.zip`
  (v0.4.0) became the newest Release: the tables and story syncs then went
  looking for their assets in the worldview Release, found none, and reported
  `no_data`. Any production restart after the v0.4.0 mirror release would
  have lost tables/story data on the next sync. Now lists the repo's releases
  (newest first) and picks the first Release that actually contains the
  requested `assetName` — robust to any multi-asset Release layout.

- **`checkLatestRelease` now distinguishes network failure from genuine
  absence.** It throws on network/API errors and returns `null` only when the
  API confirmed no scanned Release carries the asset. `syncRelease` uses this
  to gate the blind-download fallback: the `releases/latest/download/<asset>`
  shortcut now fires only when the API was unreachable (where it's our only
  bootstrap path through a mirror), never when the API confirmed the asset is
  absent (where it would 404 against the wrong release). The distinct error
  messages also make a misconfigured `assetName` diagnosable instead of
  masquerading as "Network unavailable". Addresses CR findings (subagent +
  khpilot bot, PR #18).

- **Defensive `per_page=30` guard.** If a full page of releases is scanned
  without a match, a warning is emitted so an asset on a later page (or a
  mirror that grew past 30 releases) doesn't fail silently as "not found".
  Forward-looking — the mirror currently ships 3 releases.

### Tests

- **`checkLatestRelease` now has unit coverage** (`tests/sync.test.ts`, 5
  tests, network-free via `globalThis.fetch` stubs). Locks in the multi-asset
  matching contract (returns the Release carrying the asset, not the newest;
  null on confirmed absence; throw on network failure) — exactly the
  regression that would have caught the original bug. Test count 157 → 162.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-06-29 — Server-version sync fix

### Fixed

- **Server version no longer drifts from `package.json`.** `server.ts` had a
  hand-maintained `SERVER_VERSION = "0.3.1"` string literal used for the
  startup log line and the MCP `initialize` handshake's `serverInfo.version`.
  It wasn't bumped alongside `package.json` during releases, so v0.3.2 shipped
  with the server reporting "0.3.1" in its logs and protocol handshake despite
  being the 0.3.2 package. Now read dynamically from `package.json` via a JSON
  import (`import pkg from "../package.json"`), making `package.json` the
  single source of truth. Surfaced when updating the production deployment to
  0.3.2 and seeing the stale version in the startup journal.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-06-29 — Code-debt cleanup & tool-description polish

### Changed

- **Improved tool descriptions for better client-side tool selection (RAG
  recall).** All 15 `ef_*` tool descriptions were revised under three
  principles: (1) added reverse-anchor "适用场景" (when-to-use) cues so the
  calling LLM can pick the right tool from a natural-language user request;
  (2) de-duplicated the `ef_get_character_archives` / `ef_get_character_voices`
  / `ef_get_character_basic_info` opening lines, which previously all began
  "获取指定角色的…" and diluted each other's embedding similarity; (3)
  preserved and tightened the existing search→read workflow guidance.
  Description text only — parameter schemas and handler logic unchanged.

- **Unified `{id, text}` localization type across the character domain**:
  `texts.ts`'s exported `LocalizedText` is now the single canonical type for
  every `{id, text}` localization ref. Removed three file-private duplicates:
  `characterProfiles.ts`'s `RecordField` (and its four `as LocalizedText`
  casts at the `resolveText()` call sites), plus `characterTable.ts`'s
  `LocalizedField` (used by `CharacterEntry.name`) and `CvField` (used by the
  four `cvName.*` CV fields). Pure type-layer change; runtime behaviour and
  output are unchanged. Resolves the type-duplication debt item in STATUS.md.
  (#13)

### Decisions

- **Evaluated and declined `characterEnums.ts` enum dynamization (wontfix).**
  The sibling debt item — making the three profession/charType/weaponType name
  maps dynamic instead of hardcoded — was investigated and closed as
  wontfix. Profession and charType have source tables in the mirror
  (`CharProfessionTable` / `CharTypeTable`), but (1) the enum values are
  verified constants that rarely change across game updates (profession /
  attribute / weapon-type are base design, not tuning data); (2) the only real
  benefit of dynamization would be multilingual profession/attribute names,
  which the current tools don't need since they always output Chinese (YAGNI);
  (3) `weaponType` has no source table (the mirror ships `EquipTable` only),
  so dynamization would leave a mixed hardcoded/dynamic shape breaking the
  module's single responsibility; (4) dynamizing would force a deliberately
  pure-data module to take a store dependency, against the layering intent it
  was split out for. The hardcoded maps are the reasonable terminal state.
  Revisit if future character tools gain a `lang` option that needs localized
  profession names.

- **Deferred standardized pagination `{total, offset, limit, items}` and
  structured errors `{error_code, message}` to the 2.0-boundary output-format
  strategy.** Both items were drafted into the 0.3.2 patch line assuming a
  structured-JSON output model, but the project evolved toward markdown text
  content (which is friendlier to the LLM consumers MCP targets). Forcing
  them in now would (a) touch the output format — a 1.0-compatibility surface
  — piecemeal rather than as a coherent strategy, and (b) for structured
  errors, likely *reduce* LLM-friendliness (error codes need a second lookup
  that natural-language Chinese messages don't). Current list sizes (~29
  characters, a few dozen chapters) don't overflow context, so pagination has
  no present payoff. Both belong with the 2.0-boundary `output_format=
  markdown|json` selector decision (ROADMAP.md), not scattered individual-tool
  changes now.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-29 — Tech-debt cleanup

### Added

- **Story bundled fallback**: the build-time `fetch-bundled-data.ts` script now also downloads `endfield-story-CN.zip` (extracting into `data/endfield/story/`), so the npm package ships the story bundle as an offline fallback alongside the tables bundle. Previously only tables were bundled — story tools had no offline fallback despite the runtime store wiring (`FallbackStore` with a bundled layer) being in place since v0.3.0. The CD pipeline now verifies `data/endfield/story/index.json` is populated before packing.

### Changed

- **Project rename `EndField`/`EndFiled` → `Endfield`**: corrected the project name to match the official game spelling (Arknights: **Endfield**). Two wrong forms had proliferated since the repo's creation — a transposed-character typo `EndFiled` (the GitHub repo name + derived git URLs, package.json metadata) and a non-canonical capitalization `EndField` (~35 doc/comment/runtime-string occurrences). All unified to `Endfield-MCP`. The npm package name `endfield-mcp`, all `endfield` runtime data paths, and the separate `EndFieldGameData` mirror repo are unchanged (correct or out of scope). Two runtime strings updated: the GitHub-sync User-Agent (`sync.ts`) and the server startup log line (`server.ts`).
- **npm Trusted Publishing**: CD now publishes with `--provenance` and authenticates via GitHub Actions OIDC instead of a long-lived `NPM_TOKEN` secret. The `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` env binding is removed; npm trust is established through the Trusted Publisher configured on the npm package. `setup-node` is pinned to Node 24 — Trusted Publishing's OIDC PUT flow needs npm ≥ 11.5.1, and Node 24 is the first LTS bundling npm 11.x. (Node 22's npm 10.x can sign provenance but its OIDC PUT is incomplete, returning a misleading E404; Node 20 fails outright. Verified against PRTS-MCP's successful publishes on Node 24.14.0 + npm 11.9.0.) `id-token: write` was already present (declared for provenance in v0.2.0 but unused until now).
- **Mirror contract doc** (`docs/admin/mirror-release-workflow.md`): rewritten from a speculative design draft into a locked consumer-side contract — documents the published zip structures (tables + story), version-numbering policy, and the current manual-export reality, with the self-hosted-runner automation deferred. Three stale `SCHEMA_TODO` comments (`datasets.ts`, `startupSync.ts` ×2) plus one related stale placeholder (`config.ts`) replaced with declarative notes (the mirror is live, requiredFiles are pinned, readers landed in v0.2/v0.3).

### Fixed

- `ef_search_characters` now caps `pattern` at 200 characters (ReDoS hardening), aligning with `ef_search_stories`. Previously only the story tool enforced the limit.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-22 — Creation-oriented tools

### Added

- **Character archives**: `ef_get_character_archives` — returns a character's background-story text (3 sections: basic profile / personnel summary / archive material). Data source: CharacterTable.profileRecord. Rich-text tags (`<@...>`, `<#...>`, `</>`) stripped by cleanProfileText.
- **Character voices**: `ef_get_character_voices` — returns voice line text with trigger conditions (55-79 lines per character). Data source: CharacterTable.profileVoice.
- **Story domain** (4 tools): `ef_list_story_chapters` (364 chapters), `ef_list_stories` (scenes within a chapter), `ef_read_story` (full dialogue scene), `ef_search_stories` (full-text search across 9271 scenes). Data source: `endfield-story-CN.zip` (v0.3.0 Release on EndFieldGameData, 19MB).
- **Story data reader** (`data/story.ts`): catalog (index.json) loads eagerly; conv/ files load on-demand per scene read. Chapter derivation via mission-id prefix grouping. Search via pre-built search.json index.
- **Character profile reader** (`data/characterProfiles.ts`): archives + voices projection with rich-text cleaning.
- **Story types** (`data/storyTypes.ts`): StoryLine (dialog/narration/choice), StoryEntry, StoryChapter, StoryScene.
- **Mirror**: `endfield-story-CN.zip` published as v0.3.0 Release on 3aKHP/EndFieldGameData (9275 files, 19MB).
- **Build script**: `build-story-zip.ts` for packing story bundle with forward-slash entry names.
- **Smoke test**: `smoke-creation.ts` for live verification of archives/voices/story tools.

### Changed

- **Character tool surface refactored** to PRTS-MCP three-way split: deleted `ef_get_character_info` (numeric-biased), added `ef_get_character_archives` (story text), `ef_get_character_voices` (voice lines), `ef_get_character_basic_info` (numeric info, renamed from the deleted tool's projection). Matches PRTS-MCP's get_operator_archives / get_operator_voicelines / get_operator_basic_info design.
- `characters.ts`: extracted `resolveCharacterEntry()` from `getCharacterInfo()` so characterProfiles.ts reuses the same id/CN-name/EN-name lookup.
- `startupSync.ts`: added STORY_CN dataset sync (own runner, own retry, clearStoryCaches on update).
- `server.ts`: story store always constructed unconditionally via FallbackStore (matching GameData pattern — never gate binding on directory existence, or background sync data is permanently missed).
- `datasets.ts`: added STORY_CN ReleaseDatasetSpec.
- `withGracefulError` extracted to shared `tools/toolRuntime.ts` (was duplicated in gamedataTools + storyTools).
- Version bumped to 0.3.0 (first public release).

### Fixed

- `cleanProfileText` now strips `<#...>` tag family (870+ i18n values use these status/effect tags), not just `<@...>`. Addresses CR #2 S3.
- Story conv files parsed with `readJsonInt64Safe` (defensive — conv line `id` fields are int64-sized). Addresses CR #2 S4.
- `searchStories` caches the 9271-entry key→entry Map at module level instead of rebuilding on every call. Addresses CR #2 S6.
- Story store bound unconditionally at startup (was gated on directory existence — a regression that would permanently miss background-synced data). Addresses CR #2 B1.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-22 — GameData domain

### Added

- **GameData domain**: three new `ef_` tools over the Endfield character table.
  - `ef_list_characters(lang?)` — 29 characters with resolved names, profession, rarity, charType, department.
  - `ef_get_character_info(id_or_name, lang?)` — full detail including 4-language CV names.
  - `ef_search_characters(pattern, max_results?, lang?)` — regex search across names, id, profession, charType, department.
- **Self-hosted mirror** ([3aKHP/EndFieldGameData](https://github.com/3aKHP/EndFieldGameData)): v0.2.0 Release published with `endfield-tables.zip` (10 core tables + 5 localization languages, 23MB).
- **Auto-sync** (`data/sync.ts`): GitHub Release sync with cascade fallback (`GITHUB_MIRRORS`), TTL cache, atomic write, offline fallback to cached data. Hash comparison skips download when release tag unchanged.
- **Bundled fallback** (three-tier availability): `fetch-bundled-data.ts` build-time script populates `ts/data/endfield/`; `server.ts` wires `FallbackStore(primary=synced, fallback=bundled)`; CD pipeline (`.github/workflows/cd.yml`) injects bundled data before npm publish.
- **i18n resolution layer** (`data/texts.ts`): Endfield separates values from localization — tables store `{id, text}` where `text` is empty and `id` is an int64 hash. This module owns the hash→string lookup across CN/EN/JP/TC/KR.
- **int64-safe JSON parsing** (`stores.ts:readJsonInt64Safe`): Endfield's localization ids exceed `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`; plain `JSON.parse` silently truncates them. String-aware preprocessor wraps large integer literals in quotes before parsing.
- **Character reader** (`data/characters.ts`): list/get/search projections with profession/rarity/charType/weaponType enum mapping and CV resolution.
- **Sync orchestration** (`startupSync.ts`): single-flight locking, exponential backoff retries (30s/120s/600s), cache-clear cascade on successful refresh.
- **CD pipeline** (`.github/workflows/cd.yml`): tag-triggered, fetches bundled data → npm publish.
- **Build/deploy scripts**: `fetch-bundled-data.ts`, `build-mirror-zip.ts` (forward-slash-enforcing packer), three smoke tests (`smoke-live`/`smoke-gamedata`/`smoke-sync`/`smoke-bundled-fallback`).
- **Tests**: +24 (8 int64-safe parsing, 16 character reader). Total 90/90.

### Changed

- `server.ts` version bumped to `0.2.0-dev.0`; binds text store before character store (dependency order); builds FallbackStore based on which data directories exist.
- `startupSync.ts` is no longer a no-op — real implementation with single-flight + retry + cache clearing.
- `.gitignore`: replaced stale PRTS-MCP entries (`gamedata/`, `storyjson/`) with Endfield-specific rules.

### Fixed

- `parseInt64Safe` rewritten to be string-aware (numbers inside JSON string values are no longer corrupted), unbounded digit length (20+ digit literals no longer produce invalid JSON), and float-safe (numbers with `.` or exponent are skipped). Addresses CR #1 B1+B2.
- `startupSync.ts` now calls `clearTextCaches()` + `clearCharacterCaches()` after a successful background refresh. Previously stale data was served until process restart. Addresses CR #1 B3.
- `texts.ts:loadLanguageIndex` uses `readJsonInt64Safe` instead of `readJson` for defense-in-depth against future i18n key format changes. Addresses CR #1 B4.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-22 — Skeleton

### Added

Initial project skeleton. End-to-end working Wiki MVP, no GameData domain
yet.

- **Project scaffold**: Bun + TypeScript + MCP SDK project layout with
  strict TS, ESM, NodeNext module resolution.
- **6 Wiki tools** (`ef_` prefix):
  - `ef_search_wiki(query, limit?, search_mode?, filter_technical?)`
  - `ef_read_wiki_page(page_title, section_index?)`
  - `ef_list_wiki_sections(page_title)`
  - `ef_get_wiki_categories(page_title)`
  - `ef_get_wiki_links(page_title, direction?, limit?)`
  - `ef_get_wiki_template(page_title)`
- **Dual transport**: stdio (default, `StdioServerTransport`) and Streamable
  HTTP stateless (`WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport` over
  `Bun.serve`). Selected via `EF_TRANSPORT` env var.
- **Wiki client** (`api/endfieldWiki.ts`): MediaWiki API client with
  built-in WAF bypass (browser UA + Referer + Accept headers), 1.5s rate
  limiter, and parsetree XML parser for template extraction.
- **Store abstraction** (`data/stores.ts`): `JsonStore` interface with
  `DirectoryStore`, `ZipStore`, `FallbackStore` implementations. Path-safety
  invariants (rejects absolute paths, `..` traversal, leading `/`).
- **Config layer** (`config.ts`): env-driven configuration with path
  priority (Docker volume → per-user dir → bundled fallback).
- **Test suite**: 53 tests across stores, sanitizer, config, wiki client
  (mocked fetch). Zero network dependencies in `bun test`.
- **CI**: GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) running
  typecheck + test + build on Linux + Windows, Bun 1.3.
- **Runtime audit scripts**: `scripts/check-runtime.{ps1,sh}` for
  cross-platform environment verification.
- **Live smoke test**: `ts/scripts/smoke-live.ts` for manual WAF-bypass
  verification against endfield.wiki.gg (not part of `bun test`).
- **Docs**: README (bilingual), AGENTS.md, STATUS.md, ROADMAP.md,
  `docs/dev/STYLE.md`.

### Architecture decisions

- **Single TS implementation** (no Python sibling). Rationale: PRTS-MCP's
  dual implementation was driven by Python's asyncio friction with
  Streamable HTTP; Bun+TS handles both transports natively, eliminating
  that motivation.
- **Bun runtime** (not Node). Official MCP SDK first-class support;
  native `fetch`, native `Bun.serve`, native `bun:test`.
- **Stateless HTTP transport** (no session tracking). Endfield-MCP has no
  per-session state, so stateless is strictly simpler than PRTS-MCP's
  session-pooled approach with no capability loss.
- **Wiki source: endfield.wiki.gg**. Verified MediaWiki 1.43.6 with live
  `api.php` access (requires WAF bypass headers). endfield.prts.chat and
  endfield.games were evaluated and rejected (RAG tool and pure SPA
  respectively; neither is a wiki nor has a usable API).
- **GameData: self-hosted mirror** (planned for v0.2). Will mirror only
  text-only JSON tables from endfield_research_kit exports, no binary
  assets. Private domain hosting as fallback.

### Known limitations

- GameData domain not wired (v0.2).
- Story / lore domain not wired (v0.5).
- `startupSync.ts` is a no-op placeholder.
- No Docker image yet.
- Not yet published to npm.
- Git repository not yet initialized.
